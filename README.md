# Interview Tracker 
My first project with Coding Club where we built One-stop solution to interviews.
* Most of the students face difficulties while preparing for interviews, since they do not get all essential 
  material to prepare at the same website.
* So we came up with Awesome website. From coding questions to interview experiences. This webite has it all

## Homepage
The user is directed to the Homapage after signin which looks like:

### 1. Coding Section
* The key component in preparation for interns and placements is the coding round.

* The website has various topics and questions enlisted in it for topic wise practice
